A better description will come with time.

For now though, here are the basic ways to use the program.

Download the SKLO folder in your desired location.

Ensure you have Python 3 installed, along with SKLearn, MatPlotLib, Pandas, and Numpy.

Ensure that the folder you wish to save results in is created beforehand.

Ensure that, if your dataset isn't a sample, the file is accessible locally or through a hyperlink beforehand.

To use the program, run it from the SKLOverlay Python file.

All parts have been tested in isolation and integrated, and more classifiers are going to be added down the line.

That said, there may be some small bugs. Let me know if you encounter any problems at laoluadewoye@gmail.com.

Have fun!
